Virtual DOM
Welcome to Virtual DOM! This repository contains an implementation of a virtual DOM, a key concept in modern web development frameworks like React.js. The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) of a web page. 
It serves as an intermediary layer between the application's logic and the browser's rendering engine, providing significant performance benefits by minimizing the number of updates to the actual DOM.
